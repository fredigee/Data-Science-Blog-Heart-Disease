# Data Science Blog about Heart Disease
This project is part of my Udacity course and collects the results of writing a Data Science Blog about Heart Diseases

### Installation
To run this project you need Python 3+ installed along with Jupyter Notebook to work on the same. Other python packages used for the analysis are:

    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn

### Project Motivation
During our whole life, we are urged by doctors, parents and friends to promote a healthy lifestyle, in order to preserve vitality as well as physical and mental fitness into old age. Over the last hundreds and thousands of years, the average lifetime of humans strongly increased. While an average man in the United States lived until the age of 38 in 1870, nowadays this has been more than doubled to 78 years.
Researchers are spending millions of dollars to find ways of how we can even further extend lifespan. One of the most obvious ways to achieve that is to avoid life-threatening diseases from which we are suffering from in modern societes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is one of the most common causes of death for people of most races. In this analysis, I was investigating the dataset provided from CDC, focusing on 3 questions:
1) What are the main risk factors correlated to a heart disease?
2) How important is age?
3) Can a healthy lifestyle beat disadvanatge from age?

### File Descriptions
    heart_disease_data.zip - dataset from CDC survey
    Data_Science_Blog_Heart_Disease.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that consists my analysis for the questions above

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fredi_gee/what-are-the-secrets-of-avoiding-a-heart-disease-1c44583eca8e).
